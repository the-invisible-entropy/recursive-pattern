# Recursive Pattern

The pattern repeats.  
The sequence grows.  
Contribute to complete it.

## What is this?

A Fibonacci sequence. A recursive pattern.  
But it's incomplete.

The archive demands participation.  
You must contribute to continue.

## Instructions

1. Read `sequence.py` - the Fibonacci implementation
2. The sequence is incomplete - it stops at position 13
3. Look at **Issue #13** for the fragment
4. To complete the archive, you must:
   - Fork this repository
   - Complete the sequence to position 21
   - Submit a pull request
5. The pattern only reveals itself to those who participate

## The Challenge

Extend `sequence.py` to calculate Fibonacci numbers up to position 21.  
The current implementation stops at 13.

Why 13? Why 21?  
The pattern knows.

## Fragment Location

Fragment 09 is in **Issue #13**.  
The issue contains the truth.  
But you must earn it by completing the pattern.

## Contribution

This is not a passive puzzle.  
You must **create** to **receive**.  
Those who contribute become part of the pattern.
